                            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Digital Classics Club is the first attempt of establishing an active student community focusing on creating real digital editions of classical texts with high level open source tools. 
                    It was started by the students of the Survey of Greek Literature of the Academic Year 2016-2017 at the University of Tufts (Boston, MA), and it is currently managed and maintained by Professor Gregory Crane and the Teaching Fellow Chiara Palladino.
                </p>
                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                    The goal of the Club is to get the members acquainted with available digital tools for textual analysis and editing, gaining consistent experience in treebanking, text alignment, annotation of named entities, XML TEI formatting, and at the same time contributing significantly to existing databases of digital editions. Every member chooses specific passages in Ancient Greek or Latin, which are analyzed and edited through each of these tools, in order to become familiar with a specific work at all levels. The final results are publicly available, and will be posted in this repository.

                    Face-to-face meetings: Fridays 10:00-12:00 at the Perseus Office in the basement of Eaton Hall. !Important! Hours of the meetings for Semesters in 2017-2018 are going to be announced.

		 Try attending the meetings, either in person or via Google Hangouts. 
			  Members of the Club will receive weekly updates through a mailing list. If you want to truly contribute the Club, there is a few simple things that you should do in preparation for the new semester:</p>
		    <nav>
<ul>
	<li>Choose a text of your interest, or portion of text, in Greek or Latin (or any other ancient language!). It can be picked from your Reading List, or be anything that you would like to read or analyze more in depth.</li>
<li>Focus on some research questions about that text: for example, its literary intent, its figures of speech, the ways the author uses syntax to convey the message, its characters, its usage of space, its relation with different translations into modern languages, etc. Accordingly, draw a short draft of your project.</li>
<li>Have a look at the tools below. You will be required to use at least one of them in order to develop your project.</li>
<li>During the weekly meetings, you will be able to work with the tools and test how they can contribute in finding the right answers to your research questions.</li>
<li>At the end of the semester, you can write a short report about your results. It will be published on this Wiki page, together with links to your work. Your data will contribute instantly to the crowdsourced databases connected to each tool, and it will benefit other users who may be interested in the same texts!</li>
